Additional idea list:
1. Have the player collect extra parts such as spoilers, hydraulic and other accessories. 
Adds price onto the car and once they have collected them all then the apperance of the car could change.

2. Put high value parts that the player would have to travel to another map to be able to collect 
(e.g. could have a tile that would render a different variation of the main map off screen)

3. Add a time limit that they player would have to collect the main and additional parts for, 
the closer the time gets to 0 then the quicker the AI will collect the parts.

4. Add difficult maps which would be optional to the player, 
maybe add various different tiles that are placed in one section of the map that the player could optionally travel to. 
This could give us more options to be able to add in search and sort algorithms. 

5. Could add a mechanic that would be able to fit the parts progressively as the player collects them, 
although doing this would deplete the funds that they have collected and force them to go and collect more parts, 
but doing this also drastically increases the speed of the car so collecting parts would be easier.
