Game Idea:

Two cars,

One AI controlled using search and sort algorithms

One Player controlled.

Car parts are placed upon the map, the AI searches for the cheapest parts and creates a mpa of each part, price and location of parts

Upon picking up a part, either from player or AI, the AI car then recreates the item map and re-searches for the new cheapest/closest part they need.

Upon picking up all th parts the player/AI must then get to the ending point for the final sorting algorithm to take place.

All parts are sorted alphabetically and softed by each items price, adding all of them together to create a final car price.


Bounderies are found in the form of buildings/map bounderies.

Items are placed randomly around the map in player accessible locations.

Some places that player can access but the AI cannot.
